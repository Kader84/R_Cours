Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
===========================================

Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. In the R script, I try to do the following:

* Download the dataset in the working directory
* Load the activity and feature info
* Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
* Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
* Merges the two datasets
* Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
* Creates a tidy dataset - the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair-.

* At the end, result is shown in the file tidyData.txt.
